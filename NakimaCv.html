			<h2>IT Administrator (Graduate Recruitment Bureau) - Dec 2012 to Present:</h2>
			<p>I am the first point of contact when users are experiencing issues and provide them with all lines of support.

			<p>Upgrading the operating systems on servers and virtual machines from Windows Server 2003 to Windows Server 2012, to get the latest array of tools and features to manage the servers better.  I have migrate virtual machines from the vSphere platform onto Hyper-V servers, as we are able to host an unlimited amount of VMs. </p>
			<p>Put in place DHCP failovers that saves a 5% pool of IP addresses to be used by another domain controller if the main one fails. I have also setup the Distributed File System Replication feature on a domain controller so that all files on a network can be replicated between the two controllers to create a form of redundancy enabling users access to all their files and folders if one goes down.</p>
			<p>Built a web application and kiosk on an embedded device from scratch to computerize the way the company records their KPIS. C# was used to code the back end and HTML, JQuery and CSS to code the front. A database was also created in Microsoft’s SQL server management studio to store all the data and communicate with other databases that contain relevant information. Within the database stored procedures, functions, views and SQL Report Builder was used to help save and manage the data and present it in a user readable way.</p>
