						<h1> Employment </h1>
						<div id="EmploymentDetails">
							<h2>IT Administrator (Graduate Recruitment Bureau) - Dec 2012 to Present:</h2>
							<p>I am the first point of contact when users are experiencing issues and provide them with all lines of support. I solve issues ranging from replacing faulty hardware equipment such as motherboards and hard disks, to fixing software issues such as corrupted operating systems, browser issues, and driver issues.</p>
							<p>Managing the network and servers to make sure they are running smoothly without faults and client machines are all monitored and protected correctly using Kaspersky’s administration security centre.</p>
							<p>Upgrading the operating systems on servers and virtual machines from Windows Server 2003 to Windows Server 2012, to get the latest array of tools and features to manage the servers better.  I have migrate virtual machines from the vSphere platform onto Hyper-V servers, as we are able to host an unlimited amount of VMs. </p>
							<p>Put in place DHCP failovers that saves a 5% pool of IP addresses to be used by another domain controller if the main one fails. I have also setup the Distributed File System Replication feature on a domain controller so that all files on a network can be replicated between the two controllers to create a form of redundancy enabling users access to all their files and folders if one goes down.</p>
							<p>Built a web application and kiosk on an embedded device from scratch to computerize the way the company records their KPIS. C# was used to code the back end and HTML, JQuery and CSS to code the front. A database was also created in Microsoft’s SQL server management studio to store all the data and communicate with other databases that contain relevant information. Within the database stored procedures, functions, views and SQL Report Builder was used to help save and manage the data and present it in a user readable way.</p>

				    <h1> Soft Skills</h1>
				    <div>
				        <p>Team work: I have learned since the care home to work efficiently in a team and have evolved this skill in my current role. My team work together to fix issues that affect the whole system or when one of us is stuck on a problem.</p>
				        <p>Communication:  My communication skills have since been developed from the care home while I have been working at GRB. I have to liaise with many different teams within the company while solving support issues as well as provide support for external users of the company. I also have to contact companies related to IT sales or other companies support teams. </p>
				        <p>Organisation: Working at the care home and GRB has taught me to be very organised with the way I handle my tasks. There are many issues that come in needed to be fixed so I have to stay on top of which are being worked on and which have urgent priority, all the while keeping on top of my usual daily monitoring.</p>
				        <p>Time management: Juggling many tasks has made me become more efficient at managing my time. Some issues require a lot of work, so I have to make decisions as to when to halt them to complete the more urgent work on the list to adhere to the deadlines.</p>
				        <p>Customer Service: One of my main tasks while working not only at the care home but also at GRB is to provide the best customer service I can. This means being professionally polite and approachable as well as being able to explaining tasks and features to the staff who are not tech savvy or have no knowledge of the product to hand.</p>
				        <p>Independence: Throughout my experience at GRB I have been given a lot of responsibility, which means that I have to be very self-reliant in what I do. I am able to complete given tasks with little assistance.</p>
